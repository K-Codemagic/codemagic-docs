When you have moved your repository or need to update the username/password or private key used to access it, you can change the access details in **App settings > Repository settings > Repository access settings**. You can also generate a new private key. Once you have changed the relevant settings, click **Update access settings**. Codemagic will verify it has access to the repository using the updated details before saving the settings.
